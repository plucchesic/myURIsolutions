[My URI profile](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/judge/pt/profile/526410)


These are my solutions to URI online judge problems. They are made in C++ and Python, which are the main languages i have been coding in. I will be updating this repository as i complete more challenges.

I hope this helps you somehow. I am far from being an expert in any language i code in, but, since i am a beginner, i think my solutions may be simple and good enough for anyone to understand it.

I accept any kind of feedback and suggestions to make them better though! :)
