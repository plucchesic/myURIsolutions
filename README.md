These are my solutions to beginner URI online judge problems. They are made in C++ and Python, which are the main languages i have been coding in.

I hope this helps you somehow. I am far from being an expert in any language i code in, but, since i am a beginner, i think my solutions may be simple and good enough for anyone to understand it.


I accept any kind of feedback and suggestions to make them better though! :)
